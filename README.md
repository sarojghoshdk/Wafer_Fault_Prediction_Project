# üìÑ‚úè Sensor Fault Detection Project

**Brief:** In electronics, a **wafer** (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor, such as a crystalline silicon (c-Si), used for the fabrication of integrated circuits and, in photovoltaics, to manufacture solar cells. The wafer serves as the substrate(serves as foundation for contruction of other components) for microelectronic devices built in and upon the wafer. 

It undergoes many microfabrication processes, such as doping, ion implantation, etching, thin-film deposition of various materials, and photolithographic patterning. Finally, the individual microcircuits are separated by wafer dicing and packaged as an integrated circuit.

## Problem Statement
Wafers are predominantly used to manufacture solar cells and are located at remote locations in bulk and they themselves consist of few hundreds of sensors. Wafers are fundamental of photovoltaic power generation, and production thereof requires high technology. Photovoltaic power generation system converts sunlight energy directly to electrical energy.

The motto behind figuring out the faulty wafers is to obliterate the need of having manual man-power doing the same. And make no mistake when we're saying this, even when they suspect a certain wafer to be faulty, they had to open the wafer from the scratch and deal with the issue, and by doing so all the wafers in the vicinity had to be stopped disrupting the whole process and stuff anf this is when that certain wafer was indeed faulty, however, when their suspicion came outta be false negative, then we can only imagine the waste of time, man-power and ofcourse, cost incurred.

# Dataset Information : 
Available in EDA under the notebooks folder
#### Dataset is taken from Kaggle and stored in mongodb

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project.
  
- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.

- `README.md`: This file is an outcome of displaying the projects documentation.

- `app.py`: This is the Flask application file responsible for hosting the web application.

- `notebooks`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, visualization and model training . The `data` folder within this directory contains the dataset used for this project.

- `setup.py`: This is the setup file for the project, which may include additional configuration settings.

- `src`: This directory contains the source code for the project, organized into several subdirectories and files:
    - `logs`: This directory contains log files generated by the project.
    - `components`: This directory contains Python modules for various project components, including:
        - `data_ingestion.py`: Handles the process of loading and preparing the dataset.
        - `data_transformation.py`: Performs data preprocessing and feature engineering.
        - `model_trainer.py`: Contains code for training and evaluating machine learning models.
    - `pipelines`: This directory contains data processing or machine learning pipelines used in the project, including:
        - `training_pipeline.py`: Defines the training pipeline for model development.
        - `prediction_pipeline.py`: Defines the pipeline for making predictions using the trained model.
    - `exception.py`: Thos file provide a way to create and raise user-defined errors with specific context and messaging, enhancing error handling and code clarity.
    - `logger.py`: This file helps us to record and manage application events and information, facilitating debugging and monitoring.
    - `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used throughout the project.
 
- `artifacts` : This folder contains the train,test and raw csv files along with the preprocessed and best model pickle file.

- `templates` : This folder contains the HTML files used for obtaining user input via form and flask uses these files as a rendering template.
